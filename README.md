# Rutherford-Scattering

Contains files for a numerical simulation of Rutherford Sscattering, i.e. particle scattering due to a central, inverse-square-law force, best known for Rutherford's application in his Gold Foil Experiment. In this particular simulation, the phase-space trajectory of the scattered particles is approximated by numerically solving Hamilton's equation (Time-derivatives of position and momentum are given by the partial derivatives of the Hamiltonian).

'scattering-process.f95' is a FORTRAN program that performs the intense numerical computations
